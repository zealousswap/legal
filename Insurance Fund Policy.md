# Zealous Ecosystem Insurance Fund Policy

**Effective Date:** June 29 2025 *(updated to include Fervent Finance as of August 2025)*

This Insurance Fund Policy (“Policy”) outlines the principles, scope, and limitations of the **Zealous Ecosystem Insurance Fund** (“Insurance Fund”), a protocol-native reserve designed to help mitigate user losses in the event of a protocol-related incident on either **Zealous Swap** or **Fervent Finance**.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Insurance Fund

The Insurance Fund is designed to provide a safety mechanism for users interacting with:

* Zealous Swap (DEX, staking, liquidity pools, etc.)
* Fervent Finance (lending and borrowing)

The primary goal of the Insurance Fund is to compensate affected users for losses caused **exclusively** by vulnerabilities in either Zealous Swap’s or Fervent Finance’s smart contracts.

---

## 2. Funding Mechanism

The Insurance Fund is continuously funded by:

* A portion of protocol fees (5%) collected from **Zealous Swap transactions**
* **5% of Fervent Finance’s total platform revenue**
* Additional contributions funded by governance if needed

> This creates a shared safety net across the Zealous ecosystem that grows as both platforms generate more activity.

---

## 3. Covered Events

The Insurance Fund **may** be used to cover user losses resulting from:

* **Smart contract exploits or vulnerabilities** originating within Zealous Swap or Fervent Finance
* **Unexpected protocol failures** on either platform

---

## 4. Exclusions and Limitations

The Insurance Fund **does not cover**:

* MEV-related losses (front-running, sandwich attacks, etc.)
* Liquidation losses on Fervent Finance due to health factor drop
* Volatility-based or impermanent losses in liquidity pools
* User errors (phishing, private key loss, incorrect transactions)
* Losses from third-party or non-integrated protocols
* Losses due to market activity or price crashes

> The Fund is not a guarantee of reimbursement. All claims are subject to eligibility review and fund availability.

---

## 5. Claims and Payout Process

In the event of a qualifying exploit or incident:

1. Zealous or Fervent core contributors and/or auditors assess the incident
2. The scope of impact is determined and affected users are identified
3. Governance or multisig signers decide whether the Insurance Fund should be used
4. If approved, compensation is made proportionally based on available funds and total losses

---

## 6. Governance and Transparency

* The Insurance Fund is managed by **ZEAL governance** (via multisig or DAO in the future)
* The fund balance and usage will be transparently reported via dashboards or community updates
* Any future changes to this policy or the contribution percentages are subject to governance

---

## 7. No Warranties or Guarantees

The Insurance Fund is a risk-mitigation tool — **not a regulated insurance product**. Participation in Zealous Swap or Fervent Finance is still at your own risk. While we strive to maintain the highest level of protocol security, we cannot guarantee full protection or reimbursement.

---

## 8. Incident Reporting and User Communication

In case of a relevant incident, the protocol team will publicly communicate via official platforms to inform the community about:

* The nature of the exploit
* Whether the Insurance Fund will be deployed
* Process and timeline for any potential compensation

All decisions regarding the use of the Insurance Fund are final and made at the discretion of the protocol contributors or future governance.
