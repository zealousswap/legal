# Zealous Swap Insurance Fund Policy

**Effective Date:** June 29 2025

This Insurance Fund Policy (“Policy”) outlines the principles, scope, and limitations of the **Zealous Swap Insurance Fund** (“Insurance Fund”), a protocol-native reserve designed to help mitigate user losses in the event of a protocol-related incident.

---

## 1. Purpose of the Insurance Fund

The Insurance Fund is designed to provide a safety mechanism for users interacting with Zealous Swap, including those who participate in:

- Liquidity Pools  
- Farming and Yield Aggregation Pools  
- Infinity Pools  
- Token Staking  
- NFT Staking  
- Liquid Staking  
- Protocol-native Swaps  

The primary goal of the Insurance Fund is to compensate affected users for losses caused **exclusively** by vulnerabilities in Zealous Swap’s smart contracts.

---

## 2. Funding Mechanism

The Insurance Fund is continuously funded through a portion of the protocol fees collected from swaps. These fees are automatically allocated to the Insurance Fund as part of Zealous Swap’s fee distribution mechanism.

> Every transaction you make helps build the Fund, contributing to a more secure trading environment for all participants.

---

## 3. Covered Events

The Insurance Fund **may** be used to cover user losses resulting from:

- **Smart contract exploits or vulnerabilities** originating within Zealous Swap’s protocol  
- **Unexpected protocol failures** caused by Zealous Swap code or infrastructure  
- **Losses to funds actively participating in** staking, farming, liquidity provision, or swaps **on Zealous Swap**

---

## 4. Exclusions and Limitations

The Insurance Fund **does not cover**:

- MEV-related losses, such as **sandwich attacks**, **front-running**, or **back-running**  
- Losses due to **user error**, including poor key management, phishing, or incorrect transactions  
- Attacks or failures originating **outside of Zealous Swap**, including third-party protocols  
- Volatility-based losses or impermanent loss  
- Losses from **non-integrated third-party contracts**, even if used in conjunction with Zealous Swap  

> The Fund is not a guarantee of reimbursement. All claims are subject to eligibility review and fund availability.

---

## 5. Claims and Payout Process

In the event of a qualifying exploit or incident:

1. Zealous Swap contributors or governance participants will assess the incident.  
2. An investigation will determine the scope of the breach and the impacted users.  
3. A decision will be made regarding whether the Insurance Fund should be used to compensate affected users.  
4. If approved, compensation will be made based on the proportion of user losses and available funds at the time.

> The use of the Insurance Fund is discretionary and not automatic. Zealous Swap makes no guarantee that the full value of any losses will be reimbursed.

---

## 6. Governance and Transparency

While Zealous Swap currently operates without on-chain governance, transparency remains a core value. Information about the size, allocation, and deployment of the Insurance Fund will be made publicly available via community updates or a dedicated dashboard.

> Any future changes to this policy or the structure of the Insurance Fund will be communicated transparently.

---

## 7. No Warranties or Guarantees

The Insurance Fund is a risk-mitigation tool — **not an insurance product regulated by any governmental body**. Participation in Zealous Swap remains at your own risk. While we strive to maintain the highest level of protocol security, Zealous Swap does not warrant that all risks are eliminated.

---

## 8. Incident Reporting and User Inquiries

Zealous Swap will make reasonable efforts to communicate with the community regarding any incidents that may involve the Insurance Fund through its official channels, such as its website, application interface, or community announcements.

If a qualifying event occurs, details regarding the investigation, eligibility, and any potential compensation process will be published transparently.

Users are encouraged to stay informed by monitoring official Zealous Swap communication platforms. All decisions regarding the use of the Insurance Fund are final and made at the sole discretion of the protocol contributors or governance process, if applicable in the future.
